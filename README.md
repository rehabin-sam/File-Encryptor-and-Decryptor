# File-Encryptor-and-Decryptor
"Bread: File Encrypter and Decryptor" is a user-friendly GUI application developed in Python using "customtkinter' and 'tkinter' that enables secure file encryption and decryption. Users can upload a file via a file dialog, which is then encrypted using the 'cryptography' library's 'Fernet' module, with the resulting file saved with a '.bread' extension. The application generates and displays the encryption key for the user to save. Decryption is achieved by entering the provided key, restoring the file to its original state and deleting the encrypted version. The interface features a customizable theme, background image, and an organized layout with labels, buttons, and text entry fields, ensuring ease of use for protecting sensitive files.
